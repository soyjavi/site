I'm going to try to keep updating my blog at least once a week. I know it's all about being consistant, but I'm gonna do it! I'm going to start with this update of my **reading list**.

First I'd like to mention a book that I finally read a couple of months ago. I think it's a must-read for anyone who tries to improve professionally, day-to-day. I'm talking about [Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do) by [Dave Hoover](https://twitter.com/davehoover) and [Adewale Oshineye](https://twitter.com/ade_oshineye). It's a **guide** of patterns and actions that should be like a reference to look back at along our *journey*, some are more difficult than others to forget. Today I'm following one of the given patterns by keeping an open and updated reading list.

After a month without reading anything, I took advantage of my holidays to read [Software Craftsmanship](https://leanpub.com/socra) by [Sandro Mancuso](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso). In the book, the author talks about values, attitude, and motivation for the aspiring **software craftsman**. What is Software Craftsmanship? Is it trying to replace Agile? How can I encourage my team to follow eXtreme Programming (XP) and become better professionals? All those questions are developed in the book, but not just that. The author also talks about recruiting and finding partnership from the point of view of developers and companies. He gives guidance, not only on how to find a company aligned with your values, but also on finding people who actually want to **craft code** and not just type code. All of that makes the book a great reading, not just for developers but also for managers and companies that want people who really give value. I really enjoyed it!

If you, just like me, feel that your job is **not** *just a job*, and you want to: be a better professional, walk this long road to mastery, share your knowledge... Then these two books are a must-read. So, on that note, here is my list with the next books I'm going to read:

1. [Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign) by [Corey Haines](https://twitter.com/coreyhaines).
2. [Hacking your education](http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Your-Education-Lectures-Thousands/dp/0399159967) by [Dale J. Stephens](https://twitter.com/DaleJStephens)
3. [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) by [Andrew Hunt](https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy) and [David Thomas](https://twitter.com/pragdave)
4. [Software Architecture for Developers](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers) by [Simon Brown](https://twitter.com/simonbrown)
