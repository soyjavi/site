## 2 – Automatic Investing
Many cryptocurrency exchanges allow you to select the option of auto-investing. You can decide the amount of money your want to put on bitcoin and they automize that. Every period of time an amount of money is automatically invested in bitcoin.

You can choose the amount of money and period depending on your situation. No amount is too small, and no period is too long. It could be $20 a week, it could be $50 a month, you choose.

The idea of automatic investing is very powerful, as it allows you to dissociate yourself from the volatility of the market if that’s the thing that keeps you away from the space. It allows you to choose the amount of money that you are willing to invest and simply forget about it. When you look at you account in a year or two you are going to be amazed of how much money you have accumulated. This method is called dollar cost averaging and can be very powerful for patient people.

It’s very important to choose the amount of money you can afford to lose. These are still early stages of the technology and volatility is in the highest level.

## 1 – Eliminate Bad habits
We all have bad spending habits that we would like to eliminate. Psychologist have discovered that it’s more powerful to replace a bad habit with a good habit then simple eliminating the habit.

A bad habit might be a coffee at Starbucks every morning. Coffee that you could be eliminating by making it at home and put the saved amount in bitcoin. If you spend $3 on coffee every morning that’s $15 a week. This will be $900 a year saved and put into bitcoin.


## 3 – One time buy
A third way to get some bitcoins is to just allocate an amount of money, put it in bitcoin and simply forget about it for a long period of time. This method is for the people who cannot deal with the stress of a volatile market.

I cannot emphasize enough that you should only allocate what you can afford to lose. And never use credit to buy bitcoin.

More importantly, do your own research. Make sure you develop an understanding around this new technology. Make sure you know why you are in the space and make sure you understand why bitcoin is valuable.

## Conclusion
As much as I believe in bitcoin, it’s undeniable that it’s still a very volatile unpredictive market. Trying to catch the momentum in such market is almost impossible for average people who have non-trading jobs cannot follow the market on a minute by minute basis.

The methods I have highlighted are for the average person who doesn’t have the time to follow the market. But they can allocate some time to understand bitcoin before making an investment.
