### resume
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always had a love for coding. I strive to design simple, clean, and beautiful products with the hope that they make a difference in the world. Currently I’m the Head of the Frontend Engineering team at MediaSmart.

I’m always up for a new challenge. I'm available for freelance work, so if you think I could help, please reach out to me at <a href='mailto:hello@soyjavi.com'>my mail</a>.
